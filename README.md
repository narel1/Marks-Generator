# Marks-Generator

We are making GUI/web based interface that will not only give csv file as an output for preprocessing but also provide an alternative for
calculating negative in google quiz which is not available by setting up the desired values for positive and negative marks.
We would be given input file in .csv format and in output for each candidiate we would generate his marksheet in xlsx and one concise file
that will contain information for marks before and after negative and we will email each candidates on their instution mail address.
# Technologies used
